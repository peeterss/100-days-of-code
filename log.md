# 100 days of code _ log

### day 000: 3 september 2019 _ commitment

**today's progress:** started this repo from almost scratch.  didn't want to clone, did copy, paste.

**thoughts:** in need of having to learn git.  trail and errored some tutorials prior ot this.  will learn.

plan:
* python, django, wagtail, django-rest-framework, yaml
* tdd, git, graph database, ops
* frontend: css, webflow, react if needed, html, github markdown

why: 
1. company backend
2. also frontend, eventually.

### day 001: 4 september 2019 _ setting up

**today's progress:** fired up a new wagtail site 'asite' and tried to add git.

**thoughts:**  github doesn't seem to guide creating a repo locally.  bad documentation.  could be me.
will look into git tomorrow. seems necessary, needed.

will start with git tomorrow, before adding the blog app (tutorial).

### day 002: 5 september 2019 _ continue

**today's progress:** got blog rolling. mainly executing a tutorial and debugging.

**thoughts:**  was fun.  tomorrow i will be fixing default ssh keys.  they still have a passphrase, not handy when commiting.  also looking into git. just 1h, chess afterward.

### day 003: 6 september 2019 _ ssh keys + git branching, tagging

**today's progress:** creating a ssh key without passphrase was a breeze as the config.  will be reading about git tagging and braching.

**thoughts:**  today is just fixing ssh keys and reading.  tomorrow i'll be going further, longer.
