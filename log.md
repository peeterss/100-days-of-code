# 100 days of code _ log

### day 000: 3 september 2019 _ commitment

**today's progress:** started this repo from almost scratch.  didn't want to clone, did copy, paste.

**thoughts:** in need of having to learn git.  trail and errored some tutorials prior ot this.  will learn.

plan:
* python, django, wagtail, django-rest-framework, yaml
* tdd, git, graph database, ops
* frontend: css, webflow, react if needed, html, github markdown

why: 
1. company backend
2. also frontend, eventually.

### day 001: 4 september 2019 _ setting up

**today's progress:** fired up a new wagtail site 'asite' and tried to add git.

**thoughts:**  github doesn't seem to guide creating a repo locally.  bad documentation.  could be me.
will look into git tomorrow. seems necessary, needed.

will start with git tomorrow, before adding the blog app (tutorial).

### day 002: 5 september 2019 _ continue

**today's progress:** got blog rolling. mainly executing a tutorial and debugging.

**thoughts:**  was fun.  tomorrow i will be fixing default ssh keys.  they still have a passphrase, not handy when commiting.  also looking into git. just 1h, chess afterward.

### day 003: 6 september 2019 _ ssh keys + git branching, tagging

**today's progress:** creating a ssh key without passphrase was a breeze as the config.  will be reading about git tagging and braching.

**thoughts:**  today is just fixing ssh keys and reading.  tomorrow i'll be going further, longer.

### day 009: 12 september 2019 _ django read up

**today's progress:** started banging out with django 3. then realised directory structure and project setup coudl be better.  also have to zoom out and design what to create.  instead of just following tutorials.    

**thoughts:**  tomorrow i will read up on project structure. to get tdd running and actually start writing tests first.  haven't add git to project, will probably restart it.
