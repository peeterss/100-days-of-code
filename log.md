* tdd, git, graph database, ops
* frontend: css, webflow, react if needed, html, github markdown

why:

### day 001: 4 september 2019 _ setting up

**today's progress:** fired up a new wagtail site 'asite' and tried to add git.

**thoughts:**  github doesn't seem to guide creating a repo locally.  bad documentation.  could be me.
will look into git tomorrow. seems necessary, needed.

will start with git tomorrow, before adding the blog app (tutorial).
