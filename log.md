# 100 days of code _ log

### day 000: 3 september 2019 _ commitment

**today's progress:** started this repo from almost scratch.  didn't want to clone, did copy, paste.

**thoughts:** in need of having to learn git.  trail and errored some tutorials prior ot this.  will learn.

plan:
* python, django, wagtail, django-rest-framework, yaml
* tdd, git, graph database, ops
* frontend: css, webflow, react if needed, html, github markdown

why: 
1. company backend
2. also frontend, eventually.

### day 001: 4 september 2019 _ setting up

**today's progress:** fired up a new wagtail site 'asite' and tried to add git.

**thoughts:**  github doesn't seem to guide creating a repo locally.  bad documentation.  could be me.
will look into git tomorrow. seems necessary, needed.

will start with git tomorrow, before adding the blog app (tutorial).

### day 002: 5 september 2019 _ continue

**today's progress:** got blog rolling. mainly executing a tutorial and debugging.

**thoughts:**  was fun.  tomorrow i will be fixing default ssh keys.  they still have a passphrase, not handy when commiting.  also looking into git. just 1h, chess afterward.

### day 003: 6 september 2019 _ ssh keys + git branching, tagging

**today's progress:** creating a ssh key without passphrase was a breeze as the config.  will be reading about git tagging and braching.

**thoughts:**  today is just fixing ssh keys and reading.  tomorrow i'll be going further, longer.

**today's progress:** again: django rest framwork 1h, on autopilot.

### day 008: 11 september 2019 _ django rest framework, tutorial p3

**today's progress:** again: django rest framwork.    

**thoughts:**  will start with #django itself.  django 3 alpha is just out.  also try test driven development.

**link to work:** [drf tutorial repo](https://github.com/peeterss/tutorial)


### day 009: 12 september 2019 _ django read up

**today's progress:** started banging out with django 3. then realised directory structure and project setup coudl be better.  also have to zoom out and design what to create.  instead of just following tutorials.    

**thoughts:**  tomorrow i will read up on project structure. to get tdd running and actually start writing tests first.  haven't add git to project, will probably restart it.

### day 010: 13 september 2019 _ django restart

**today's progress:** repository is now actually online.  moved a directory. will read up on tdd.  django's test suite seem apt for now.    

**thoughts:**  now to the chess tournament.  this weekend first read up on tests, django 3 and then implement what i have designed.  design in between.

### day 011: 14 september 2019 _ django 3

**today's progress:** only designed what i'm going to code.  updated repo a bit.    

**thoughts:**  tdd is what i still have to look into.  slow day.

### day 012: 15 september 2019 _ documentation app

**today's progress:** coded documentation app. not much code, but am progressing.  following a tutorial to understand the framework.  with own specs and specific model.  

**thoughts:**  there's progress but it does not go that fast.  if i retain all i've learned..  it will get more complicated, i hope.  will be reading in spare time today.

### day 013: 16 september 2019 _ private repo

**today's progress:** not wasting time. i hope.  started on private repo.  trying to get it right the first time.  

**thoughts:**  not sure this is by the rules.  one shot learning.  will get there.  haven't missed a day (not under 1h).
result will be there, this year.  theory

### day 014: 17 september 2019 _ restart private repo

**today's progress:** restarted private repo, instead of just renaming.  made gist listing the steps.  

**thoughts:**  it is probably against the rules.  mainly because it is counterproductive not being open.  but i am keeping part of what i'm doing private.  end result is what counts.

### day 015: 17 september 2019 _ project_facts

**today's progress:** tried to abstract facts away from model so more (facts) could be added.  project_fact_type created, not actively used tough, yet.  

**thoughts:**  progress, will get there. has to be usable in the end..
